# Project Overview
This is the GitHub repository for the team consisting of `Karan Varindani`, `Wenyang Zhang`, and `Sibo Zhu ` for our Machine Learning final project _(Boston University CS 542, Summer 2017)_. 

## The challenge
Our project is based on research [started by HAL](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01250478/document) on learning a convolutional neural network for non-uniform motion blur removal. 

## Our approach
Our project approach is to estimate motion blur from a single, blurry image. We propose a deep learning approach to predict the probabilistic distribution of motion blur at the patch level using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
