1245 UPDATE - Abila Police have cordoned off the GAStech headquarters with additional officers arriving to secure the perimeter and to investigate what can only be described as a crime scene though the crime has not be revealed. The police response seems out of proportion for a false fire alarm.
Police officials have declined to comment at this time.
