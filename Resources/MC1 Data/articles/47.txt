GAStech, under direction of the visionary Jr of Sten Sanjorge, was granted the rights exclusive to perforate inside the governmental fields after being suitable the request of the government who 50% or more of the manual labor are citizen of Kronosian.  President Araullo hailed the distribution of the signal like "the principle of a new one was for our great country, of an era of the opportunity and the fortune for all."  Our sources in the Department of the Interior say us that the tax of 50% tax in the new exploration of the oil and the gas could render superior to $1 billion in fiscal income per year.
