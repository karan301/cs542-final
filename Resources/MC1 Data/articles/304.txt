GOVERNMENT CITES 'MINOR' CONTAMINATION NEAR ELODIS

15 October 1997

ABILA, Kronos - After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert. 

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, "pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation."

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."

The Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township.
