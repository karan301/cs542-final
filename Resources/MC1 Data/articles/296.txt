This is a misfortune to my program to help our rural municipalities, but I am not nothing if nonpersistent.  My office will send a measurement added reviewed of the tax to the assembly at the end of this year.  In addition, I will work with the office of president Kapelou to reconstruct the allocation of bottoms of present taxes of the gas and the oil to anticipate rural projects of the health."
