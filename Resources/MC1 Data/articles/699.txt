1520 UPDATE - A report from the Abila Airport indicates that a private plane departed with eight people around 2:30 PM. The chartered jet was reportedly headed towards Rome, Italy. This report appears to confirm earlier rumors that members of the GAStech leadership simply avoided reporters and the Government reception.
GAStech employees have begun to exit the building. Hopefully they will shed light on today's events.
