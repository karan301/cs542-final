ABILA, Kronos - a motion became taxes at oil and gas the development with extra 10% raise reports today at the general meeting by a voice of 77 to 23.  The presented tax increase, which by minister of health Cesare Nespola is defended, had specific financing for health care, clean water projects, and supply health information for country areas.  Minister Nespola aforesaid of the poll of the assembly, I am disappointed by the poll, but the assembly feared that the increase of tax foreign investment in our energy sector would dissuade.  This a developement is to my programme our rural help municipalities, but I am nothing as not permanent.  My office will send a revised added tax measure to the assembly later on the year.  Moreover, I will work with the office with president Kapelou's to restructure current gas and oil taxes assignment of funds of for rural health projects to provide.
