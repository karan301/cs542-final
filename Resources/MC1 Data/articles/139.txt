1947 UPDATE - From the Abila Police news conference: "There are approximately fourteen individuals unaccounted for among the GAStech staff. It has not yet been determined if all of these individuals are in fact missing."
Though it was confirmed that over a dozen individuals were unaccounted for, the Abila Police said that that does not mean they are necessarily missing. Nor does it mean that they have been abducted. At this point the case is under investigation and more information will be released as facts are learned.
