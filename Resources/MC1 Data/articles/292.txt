1158 UPDATE - The Abila Fire Department finished a thorough search of the GAStech building finding evidence of fire. At 11:45 AM they gave the all clear for the GAStech employees to re-enter the building. An AFD spokesman stated that the fire alarm appears to be a false alarm and that it was not a part of a planned fire drill.
The spokesman declined to answer whether or not the fire alarm was intentionally pulled.
