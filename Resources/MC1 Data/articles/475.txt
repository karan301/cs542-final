GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO ANOTHER ROUND OF PROTESTS 

20 June 2010 

ABILA, Kronos - Protesters aligned with the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist group surrounded government buildings chanting and carry images of their so-called martyrs. Kronos government security forces in concert with Abila police suppressed the protest with an impressive show of force.

Dressed in black the authorities donning helmets and gasmasks and brandishing riot shields, fired tear gas canisters as the protesters refused to disperse after several warnings. The group gathered proved reluctant to disperse even after the tear gas and the authorities pressed into the group protecting themselves with their shields and freely swinging their batons.

In the face of overwhelming force, most of the protesters fled; however, a hard core group stood their ground suffering the consequences. The remaining protesters were surrounded by the riot police and after repeated baton blows many were dragged away under arrest. 

When the smoke cleared amongst the discarded and trampled banners and signs, blood was clearly visible on the plaza.
