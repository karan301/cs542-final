Update, 7:00 PM:  The last of the GAStech employees has been allowed to leave the building.  The employee, Edvard Vann, said that the police interviewed him for hours and accused him of involvement in the kidnapping because he shares a family name with several POK members.  Vann, an Abila native, denied being connected to the POK.
