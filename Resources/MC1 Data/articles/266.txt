ABILA, Kronos – Four Protectors of Kronos members were arrested by Abila police last week on false drug charges.  The four citizens were attending evening poetry readings at a local café.  Witnesses report that police stormed the café, ignoring everyone but those four specific persons.  It is increasingly evident that the persecution of the POK has become official government policy.
