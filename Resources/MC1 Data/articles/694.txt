ABILA, Kronos - The healthy water awareness group, Wellness for All (WFA), has condemned both GAStech International and the Government of Kronos. WFA's statement claims widespread groundwater contamination, a lack of adequate safeguards, clean-up demands being ignored and no government oversight.  

 

However, GAStech International's Environmental Safety Advisor Ingmar Casablancas responded to the claims, "The alleged charges levied against GAStech International are unfounded. GAStech International and the Government of Kronos cooperate tirelessly to ensure a clean, safe, and prosperous work place.
