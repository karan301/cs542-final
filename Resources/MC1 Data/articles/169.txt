2021 UPDATE - A Kronos Government official who asked not to be identified but was present at the government reception has gone on the record stating, "Investigators are working around the clock to ensure that the kidnapped GAStech employees are found and that the perpetrators are brought to justice."
This is the first confirmation that today's events surrounding GAStech - Kronos are in fact a kidnapping. With fourteen individuals still unaccounted for, at this point, the assumption is that all are the victims of a kidnapping.
No group has come forward yet to claim responsibility nor have any demands been made.
