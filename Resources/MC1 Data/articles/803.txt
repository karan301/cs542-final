1506 UPDATE - Police have begun to leave GAStech headquarters. The officers have declined to answer all of the reporters' questions leaving the scene. A few police vehicles have remained behind. Presumably the remaining officers are interviewing the GAStech employees who still remain inside the company's building.
The police cordon still remains around the GAStech building.
