ABILA, Kronos - Local GAStech executives Ingrid Barranco, Ada Campo-Corrente, Orhan Strum, and Willem Vasco-Pais will attend a reception with government officials tomorrow following a business meeting at their headquarters building.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau informed The Star that Sten Sanjorge Jr., President and CEO of GAStech, has traveled from Tethys to attend the events.  The reception, hosted by President Kapelou at the Capitol Building, is being held to celebrate the 20th year of cooperation between the corporation and our country.
