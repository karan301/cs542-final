ABILA, Kronos - today the fifth anniversary of the unrealistic plan of president Araullo's is foreign investment to Kronos, a hazardous bring operation which has harvested enormous fruit for our honest country.  Abila of today are busy metropolis peak of new cars, new construction, gleaming office bldg., and modern freedoms.  Potholed streets, tired lowering factories, storefronts, and sad markets of the past have gone.  Abila of today are a city of the industry, a place of trade and investment, a place of chance and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are already better for.



However, there are still they that think found oneself that the prosperity for our bad is.  These people claim that the foreign investment for our country is bad that it dilutes our culture and undermines our values.  They claim that the aliens develop us for their own acquisition and that our government has little regard for the well-being of our people.  They are this way militant in their wrong-headed believe which they have manufactured claim that the foreign companies poison our children with their technology.  They are even to in foreign experts will have brought whom requirement our best interests with heart have to help their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people to spread out.  The schijnheiligheid of bringing in aliens our to tell that open of our country for aliens for our bad is ludicrous and is clearly a sign of mental sickness is in they which resists himself our modernization.
