ABILA, Kronos - the tried letters to be of the protectors of Kronos (POK) have been received by Vincent Kapelou, minister of the health and nephew of president Kapelou. The threatening letters nothing else appear to be the empty threats of an organization attention-whom it looks for and.



Mr. said Kapelou, the "occasions is this one is not nothing, but we are not going to take no occasions." Despite him it has doubled the size of his personal force of the security in answer to the letters.



These classes of threats reinforce only the fact that the POK are a "public threat" to quote to president Kapelou.
