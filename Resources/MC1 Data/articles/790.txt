Update, 1:25 PM:  In attempt to find out what is going on, we have called the office of Orhan Strum, the GSAtech Chief Operating Officer.  His administrator answered the phone and informed us that Mr. Strum is unavailable.  We will continue calling GAStech until we reach someone who can inform us on the situation.
