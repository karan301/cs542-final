GASTECH SHIFTS FOCUS TO KRONOS

7 July 1996

CENTRUM, Tethys - GAStech International has shifted its focus from Tethys to the small Mediterranean island of Kronos and the vast gas deposits beneath the ground.

With environmental regulation lax to nonexistent in Kronos and a friendly local government, GAStech's move feels inevitable in hindsight.
