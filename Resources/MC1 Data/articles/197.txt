 The evident confusion comes the similarity between its name and the one from a protector of the member of Kronos.



Vann, protector of security for GAStech, was furious, indicating, "I do not have anything to do nobodies with no members of group POK of the terrorist. I know nobody of Elodis. I was born here in Abila and support to my government and my president. It is being being accused and being interrogated by 6 hours like member of terrorist POK one of the worse days of my life. Hardly because a person has he himself name that a criminal does not do him a criminal."



They sent although it not to communicate with the press that Vann was firm to tensionar its innocence. With about 14 still used of GAStech inexplicable ones, one cannot blame to the police or the government not to leave to no stone unturned.
