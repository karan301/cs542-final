Drilling of the exploration had been suffered of 26 wells six years, only sufficient to a fractie of the valued oil and recover the gas to which on country oil and the gasvelden remain.

The areas of Kronos contain an abundance of still oil and gas to find and it is critical we finds the resources to the current state of exploration turn around - energy administers Jules Jecovic

The annual activity research oil and gas Kronos found a fast increase of production costs, previous year omhoog by 15%.

To the average to cost to obtain oil a barrel was omhoog by 27% in only one year, to reach K17.

The number of areas with costs by barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months.

With increasing costs, the payments of the production tax to the Treasury Kronos must fall of K3.5bn during the budget year of 2011-12 to K2bn in the current year.

After the fast fall in oil and gasproductie of areas Kronos the last years, slowed down the tariff of fall during 2012 - by 8% up to .83m barrels oil per day, or are gasequivalent.
